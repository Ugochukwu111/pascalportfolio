    longDescription:'is a web app that makes it easier for students to find, filter, and share hostel accommodations. I built the platform using modular JavaScript, applying event delegation to manage dynamic UI events efficiently and OOP principles to keep the code structured and reusable. I also leveraged array methods (map, filter, forEach) for rendering and filtering listings, while connecting to a backend API with Fetch to load and submit data in real time. The design emphasizes responsive layouts, clean UI components, and usability, making the app functional across devices.',

    longDescription:'is a lightweight web app built to help Nigerian students(UNIBEN) practice GST (General Studies) courses through interactive quizzes. I implemented it using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on dynamic question rendering and user interaction. The quiz logic was built with loops, conditionals, and array methods (map, forEach, filter) to manage questions, track answers, and calculate scores in real time. I also applied DOM manipulation to update the UI dynamically, showing feedback and results without page reloads. The design is responsive and simple, making it easy for students to access the quizzes on any device.',
